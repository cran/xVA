Description: Calculates a number of valuation adjustments including CVA, DVA,
    FBA, FCA, MVA and KVA. A two-way margin agreement has been implemented. For
    the KVA calculation four regulatory frameworks are supported: CEM, (simplified) SA-CCR, OEM
	and IMM. The probability of default is implied through the credit spreads curve.
    The package supports an exposure calculation based on SA-CCR which includes several trade types
    and a simulated path which is currently available only for Interest Rate Swaps. The latest regulatory capital charge methodologies
    have been implementing including BA-CVA & SA-CVA.
